The new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with bands like Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, Motörhead, and Saxon, played a crucial role in shaping the genre. These bands infused heavy metal with punk rock intensity, leading to fast and aggressive songs. The DIY attitude and the proliferation of independent record labels further contributed to the genre's evolution.
